    "# Define a Base Universe\n",
    "\n",
    "Before researching specific factors, we will define a base universe. We don't want to include certain securities such as ETFs and ADRS in any of our subsequent analysis, and by defining a base universe in a separate file, we can import and use the definition in our notebooks without having to re-define the universe rules in each notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "The base universe will still be quite broad, for two reasons. First, we can always add more rules to the base rules in any given notebook to narrow the universe. Second, using a broad universe will help us see how factors behave across the US equities market, even if we subsequently wish to narrow the universe for trading or further analysis.   "
